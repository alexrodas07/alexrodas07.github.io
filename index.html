   		<td>[Piece 2: In this piece I tried to capture the pure opposite of penguin-ness. The design was especially challenging here because representing objects along a four-dimensional plane proved to require more string theory than I had originally hoped.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: This piece was inspired by the Oregon Trail during a zombie apocalypse. In the multiplicity of materials used, I tried to symbolize the lingering interposition of the Freudian superego along Jungian archetypes throughout Viennese architecture.]</td>
